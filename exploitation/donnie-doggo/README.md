# Donnie Doggo

### 200 Points

## Description
Catmen has successfully burgled one of the K9's warehouses, carrying away a safe containing one of the pieces of Anubis! Unfortunately, the safe is secured with a digital lock that requires a password to open. Our intel suggests that the safe was in the possession of a K9 operative going by the alias "Donnie Doggo." The dossier Catmen put together on Donnie mentions that he likes two things: Halloween movies and reusing passwords, and at least one of these may work to our benefit. Supposedly, Donnie has been bragging at the office about writing his own *super secure* login program, but we suspect he may have bitten off more than he can chew. If you can exploit the binary and extract Donnie's password, that Anubis piece is as good as ours.

You can access Donnie's login program at `[docker_host:port]`.
