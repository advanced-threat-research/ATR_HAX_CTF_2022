## Description
We just recevied our latest correspondence from Catmen in the field:
> K9's can't coordinate if they can't keep their time and date server secure. We've previously hacked it using a buffer overflow, but they've recently added new security features, including enabling the NX bit and compliling the code with stack canaries. They think they are 100% protected but luckily I have you! Show them what you're made of!

Once you've had a chance to audit the "new and improved" `timeserver` binary for weaknesses, use it to take control of their server, which you can access at `[docker_host:port]`. Once you've gained access, retrieve any sensitive information you can find and get out.
