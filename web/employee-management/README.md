## Description
The K9 HR department is testing out a new employee database system. Thankfully, another agent got access to the system on a "staging network" `[docke_host:port]`. Your mission is to uncover a flaw in the database's security in order to retrieve the "secure" flag from the database. Catmen is convinced this enigmatic entry is the key to uncovering the location of another piece of Anubis, but she can't get it without your help!
