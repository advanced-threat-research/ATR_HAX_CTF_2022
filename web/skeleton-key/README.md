# Skeleton_Key 

### 400 Points

## Description
Catmen has stumbled across a web site `[docker_host:port]` for a piece of medical software in the K9 labs. Our intel suggests this medical software is being used on mummies excavated near the last known location of a piece of Anubis - it can't be a coincidence. Unfortunately, she don't have a valid key to unlock all the features. Catmen needs you to procure a key to unlock the full-featured software!

NOTE: The key itself is the flag - it should be placed inside of the text "ATR[]" between the square brackets when submitted.  The provided text file has a list of expired keys.

## Hint
The hint is in the file "challenge/.hint"
