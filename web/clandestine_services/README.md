# Hidden Services

### 200 Points

## Description
The Dogs have gone underground to the 'Dark Web', making it harder to track their operations. If Catmen wants to stay one paw ahead of them, we must gain access to their new communications. Unfortunately, the only clue we have to go off of is this strange text file Catmen was able to pull off of one of the dogs' laptops shortly after she witnessed him access their secret site. Find their 'hidden service' on the 'Dark Web' and say hello for me.

NOTE: This challenge can and should be done off of a corporate network. There is a high chance your IT admin will say no.
