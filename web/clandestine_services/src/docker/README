This docker is designed to run in AWS.

MAKE SURE any test docker is turned off. This fails if the docker is duplicated anywhere on the internet.

The challenge is also time sensitive. If the system time gets dysynch the challenge will faile and the docker will need to be restarted after the time synchs again.

HINT:
Not all tor hidden services are accessed via a browser. How can you test different ports in tor?


----AWS Server----
ubuntu@ec2-18-216-157-165.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
Ubuntu server 20.04
install unzip, docker


----Transfer file to AWS----
Use scp
scp -i aws_ctf_tor_services_server.pem hidden_services.zip ubuntu@ec2-18-216-157-165.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:~/ctf/

SSH command
ssh -i "aws_ctf_tor_services_server.pem" ubuntu@ec2-18-216-157-165.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
	The .PEM file is my own. Ask Charles McFarland for an AWS account so you can make your own.


----SCRIPT FILES---
**Notice the start_docker is the to start services if the server is already built**

transfer.sh - Only useful for the developer in transfer files quicker
launch.sh - Use this to launch the Docker. It adds in extra commends at the end to get the services to work.
start_docker.sh - Use this command if you've stopped the docker and wish to start it without rebuilding.

---STEP TO BUILD---
1. Zip hidden_services
2. Move ZIP to virtual machine (AWS instance)
3. from virtual machine run launch.sh


---Testing---
Create a new circuit in the tor browser and connect to the onion address. You should get plain text. I recommmend fully restarting the tor browser.

You should also test the 1337 port. You need to solve the challenge to do this so look at the spoilers below.

You need to use tor (such as the tor browser) to access this page for testing. This isn't the final answer.

To interact with the 1337 port you can telnet under tor. The easiest way to do that using ubuntu it to use "torify telnet h6lblddawb5p7dxqijifj5gmazzml3rkgpfno2pnyfnw6ymg32pbiuad.onion 1337". torify comes with the apt intall for tor. torsocks and other methods work too.
