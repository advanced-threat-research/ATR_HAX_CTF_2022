# Modnar

### 300 Points

## Description
It looks like fitness apps and peeing on hydrants aren't the only things that are popular among the K9's - Catmen (whilst undercover as a rottweiler) discovered that a lot of them have started using a new remote shell called modnar. It didn't take long for one of our techs to snag the Python file it runs, but the crypto looks a little tight - that's where you come in. Why not practice being an undercover dog yourself and fetch the flag for us?

When you're ready, connect to it at `[docker_host:port]`.
