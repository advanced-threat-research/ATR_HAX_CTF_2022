# Killer App

### 300 Points

## Description
After some recon and social engineering, Catmen has discovered an app that all the K9's have on their phones, that on the surface appears to be a harmless "fitness app" - undoubtedly a coverup for something more nefurious. Catmen managed to get her claws on the app, but seems to be having trouble actually running it. Go here `[docker_host:port]` to respond to her email ASAP!

Note: hacking this page is not part of the challenge.
