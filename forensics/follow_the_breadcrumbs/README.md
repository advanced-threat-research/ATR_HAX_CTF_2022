## Description
I've aquired a USB from the K9's. Luckily for us, those mongrels fail at basic operational security. Attached to the USB is a note "Secret key in picture". The file inside doesn't appear to be a picture though. Why don't you take a look and let me know what you can extract.

## Hint
Watch out for the K9 byte! Don't worry though, it feels more like a 'nibble'.
