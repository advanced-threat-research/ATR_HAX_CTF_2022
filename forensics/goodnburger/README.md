The K9's are trading passwords in plain sight. By using excerpts of publicly available books as their passwords, they can pass around credentials completely incognito! Catmen Sanfrancisco has provided you a SHA256 hash of their password and books she suspects they are using. Discover the sentence that pertains to the hash `AAEEA96DD86D6ECBFE21755151B00266C79368584289D15B0BFE58D6B3498A36` to help thwart their nefurious plans!
