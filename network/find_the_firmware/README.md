# Find_the_Firmware 

### 200 Points

## Description
I've got a packet capture from the K9's network. I overheard them talk about pushing firmware updates for their internal IOT devices. See if you can sniff out the firmware on the `192.168.86.0/24` subnet. Maybe there are some secrets buried in the firmware file system! According to my sources, the MD5 checksum for the embedded `download.bin` file is `7aa6a7ebcbd98ce19539b668ff790655`. I tried looking myself but I didn't find any files with that MD5. It was ruff. Maybe my tools aren't extracting correctly? See what you can do!

## Hint
The hint is in the file "challenge/.hint"
